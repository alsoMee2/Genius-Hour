	<p>A for loop is a loop<br>
	Heres how it works:<br>
	for(var x = 0; x < 10; x++){ <br>
		//double slashes are comments and JavaScript will ignore everything after it <br>
		// any command to be looped <br>

	}<br>
	x can be replaced with anything you want<br>
	var x = 0 is declaring a variable x with a value of 0 <br>
	x < 10 means repeat this loop as long as x is less than 10<br>
	x++ is shorthand for x = x + 1 which just means add 1 to x;
