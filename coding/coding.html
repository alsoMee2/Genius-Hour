    <h1>This site is about how to code in javascript.</h1>
    <body>
     <p>READ THIS TO BE NOT CONFUSED!!!<br>
            Just for this page, __ means put in a number or a variable.<br>
            --- means put in letters.<br>
            ++ means put in a number.<br>
            ... means put in letters and putting in a number is optional.<br>
            ** means <,&gt; , and = are interchangeable.<br>
            %% means &lt; and &gt;  are interchangeable.</p>
        <p>Important stuff: if you do not have the same amount of closing and opening brackets the code will automatically be wrong. ( and { are different brackets.</p>
    <p>How to create a variable <br>
        var ... = __;<br>
        what it does: it creates a variable.<br>
        notes: you can also assign it an empty array.<br>
        common mistakes: forgetting ; at the end, typos.</p>
        <p>how to create/define a function:<br>
        var __ = function(){<br>
        };<br>
            what it does: it creates a function.<br>
        common mistakes: forgetting ; at the end, typos.</p>
        <p>how to call a function<br>
        ~~();<br>
            what it does: it makes the function run again.<br>
        note: if you create coding it will automatically run in that order. if you call a function, it will run it again.<br>
        common mistkaes: forgetting ; at the end, typos.</p>
        <p>how to colour something<br>
            fill(__,__,__)<br>
            what it does: it colours everything after it.<br>
            quick tip: you can just put fill(0); for black and fill(255); for white.<br>
            note:the 1st is red, the 2nd is green, the 3rd is blue. 0 is none of that color, 255 is all of that color. Putting a number more than 255 is pointless because if the number is more than 255 it just counts it as 255.<br>
            Common mistakes: forgetting the ,s, forgetting the ; at the end, typos.<br></p>
        <p>How to colour the background<br>
            background(__,__,__)<br>
            what it does: it colours the background.<br>
            Quick tip: you can just put fill(0); for black and fill(255); for white.<br>
            Note: the 1st is red, the 2nd is green, the 3rd is blue. 0 is none of that color, 255 is all of that color. Putting a number more than 255 is pointless because if the number is more than 255 it just counts it as 255.<br>
            Common mistakes: forgetting the ,s, forgetting the ; at the end, typos.</p>
        <p>How to make a rectangle<br>
            rect(__,__,__,__);<br>
            what it does: it creates a rectangle.
            Note: the 1st and 2nd are the position of the top left corner. The 3rd and 4th are the size of the x-axis and y-axis.<br>
            Pro tip: you can add a 5th to curve the corners if you need it.<br>
            Common mistakes: forgetting ,s, forgetting ; at the end, typos.</p>
        <p>How to make an ellipse(otherwise known as circles and ovals)<br>
            ellipse(__,__,__,__);<br>
            what it does: it creates an ellipse.
            Note: the 1st and 2nd are the position of the middle, the 3rd and 4th are size of the x-axis and y-axis.<br>
            Common mistakes: forgetting the ,s, forgetting the ; at the end, typos.</p>
        <p>How to make a line<br>
            line(__,__,__,__);<br>
            what it does: it creates a line.<br>
            Note: the 1st and 2nd are the coordinates of the first point, and the 3rd and 4th are the coordinates of the second point.<br>
            Common mistakes: forgetting the ,s, forgetting ; at the end, typos.<br></p>
        <p>How to make an if statement
            if(--- === ---){<br>
            };<br>
            Or<br>
            if(--- &gt;  ---){<br>
            };
            Or
            if(--- &lt; ---){<br>
            }
            what it does: it makes a function only run if the if statement lets it.<br>
            Note: put something in between the { and } or the if statement will be useless. Also, you can add else if and else statements, which work the same way as if statements except you switch if with else if or else, and put them after an if statement.(else statements can go after else if statements, but not the other way around.<br>
            Common mistakes: using things from for loops in if statements, typos.<br></p>
        <p>How to make a for loop<br>
            for(var ~~ = __; ~~ ** ++; ~~ ** ++){<br>
            }<br>
            what it does: it makes something happen over and over again until a certain thing happens.<br>
            note: the first part says what variable, the second says on what consition, and the third says what happens.<br>
            Common mistakes: using things from if statements in for loops, forgetting var, typos.<br></p>
