    <h1>This site is a cheat sheet if you ever forget any basic terms in javascript.</h1>
    <body>
     <p>READ THIS TO BE NOT CONFUSED!!!<br>
            Just for this page, __ means put in a number or a variable.<br>
            --- means put in letters.<br>
            ++ means put in a number.<br>
            ... means put in letters and putting in a number is optional.<br>
            ** means <,&gt; , and = are interchangeable.<br>
            %% means &lt; and &gt;  are interchangeable.<br>
            bool means true or false. <br>
            and all code to draw graphics only work in HatchCanada</p>
        <p>Important stuff: if you do not have the same amount of closing and opening brackets the code will automatically be wrong. ( and { are different brackets.</p>
    <p>How to create a variable <br>
        var ... = __;<br>
        what it does: it creates a variable.<br>
        a variable is like a storage unit. A variable will store anything you give it<br>
        common mistakes: spelling mistakes</p>
        <p>how to create/define a function:<br>
        var __ = function(){<br>
        };<br>
            what it does: it creates a function.<br>
            everything inside the function will run when it is called<br>
        common mistakes: forgetting ; at the end, typos.</p>
        <p>how to call a function<br>
        ~~();<br>
            what it does: it makes the function run<br>
        common mistkaes: make sure to create the function before you call it</p>
        <p>how to colour something<br>
            fill(__,__,__)<br>
            what it does: it colours everything after it.<br>
            quick tip: you can just put fill(0); for black and fill(255); for white.<br>
            note:the 1st is red, the 2nd is green, the 3rd is blue. 0 is none of that color, 255 is all of that color. Putting a number more than 255 is pointless because if the number is more than 255 it just counts it as 255.<br>
            Common mistakes: forgetting the ,s, forgetting the ; at the end, typos.<br></p>
        <p>How to colour the background<br>

            Note: the 1st is red, the 2nd is green, the 3rd is blue. 0 is none of that color, 255 is all of that color. Putting a number more than 255 is pointless because if the number is more than 255 it just counts it as 255.<br>
            Common mistakes: forgetting the ,s, forgetting the ; at the end, typos.</p>
        <p>How to make a rectangle<br>
            rect(__,__,__,__);<br>
            what it does: it creates a rectangle.
            Note: the 1st and 2nd are the position of the top left corner. The 3rd and 4th are the size of the x-axis and y-axis.<br>
            Pro tip: you can add a 5th to curve the corners if you need it.<br>
            Common mistakes: forgetting ,s, forgetting ; at the end, typos.</p>
        <p>How to make an ellipse(otherwise known as circles and ovals)<br>

            what it does: it creates an ellipse.
            Note: the 1st and 2nd are the position of the middle, the 3rd and 4th are size of the x-axis and y-axis.<br>
            Common mistakes: forgetting the ,s, forgetting the ; at the end, typos.</p>

        <p>How to make an if statement
            if(bool){<br>
            };<br>
            else{<br>

            }<br>
            what it does: it makes a function only run if the bool is true<br>
            if it is false then it directly goes to else<br>
            else is optional<br>
        <p>How to make a <a href="forloop.html"> for loop </a><br>
            for(var ~~ = __; ~~ ** ++; ~~ ** ++){<br>

            note: the first part says what variable, the second says on what consition, and the third says what happens.<br>
